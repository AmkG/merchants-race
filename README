Merchant's Race
===============

So you want to become an established merchant, licensed to trade in goods
in some suitable town or city?  Well, the Merchant's Guild has a very
stringent, but quite simple, test: the Merchant's Race.

The goal of the Merchant's Race is for you to earn as much money as you
can, in the shortest time possible, as a travelling merchant.  You will
start in some suitable settlement in the south.  The Merchant's Guild
will graciously give you a cart to load and a horse to pull it, and
will loan you money to start your race.  Your goal is a designated
settlement in the north.  Pay for your own supplies, evade bandits, pay
back your loan, detect and avoid scams, and most importantly, earn
enough cash to impress the Merchant's Guild!
