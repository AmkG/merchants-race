{- Model for producers and consumers.  -}

{- Item producers, given a choice, will try to produce
   the most expensive items, while consumers will try
   to consume the cheapest items.

   Item producers and consumers can be either
   probabilistic producers/consumers (having a
   probability of producing/consuming each day)
   or scheduled (will produce or consume on a
   specific day of the year, give or take some
   variance).  The latter is mostly to model
   farming village harvests.  -}
